Teaching Mapping to Geographers
Steph / Alan Introduce themselves
Why? Bc as a dicipline geography has been doing mapping for a long time, natural fit? hm
Who?
Students
bring preexisting models and ideas about projects that involve mapping layers of data work
(in practice, there is an incredible range of students, most often with undergraduates: none of the above)
dbl edged sword - good (presumption of interest) bad (competing models)
OSM is a data project

...not a map

...not a GIS

Our data model is... peculiar

*	It's not exactly points lines and polygons
*	But this helps them question the assumptions of ArcGIS.

QA tools

*	All their other geography teachers are probably telling them that OSM data can't be trusted, that it's probably full of errors. 
*	So I like to show them the QA tools the expert OSM users rely on.
*	Not expecting the students to use these... yet.
*	But it shows _how_ OSM maintains its quality.
*	And it is a good pointer into the _complexity_ of the data

TIGER as a teachable moment

*	Gives them tasks to do
*	Makes them question the quality of the "professional" datasets they otherwise use.
*	Shows the variation in the OSM community.
*	Lets us start talking about licensing!

Start with a place we have in common
SFSU Aerial
No fancy editing tools
iD
Ask them to ground truth
Field papers
Introduce them to the community
diary entry
Encourage them to go further...

Student reactions: Indiana quote 

"I have been mapping and digitizing professionally with ArcGIS for nearly 5 years. This is the first time I have heard of and used OpenStreetMap and it is awesome!""

“I have set goals to make the habit of mapping areas under natural or human disasters.”

“It has been very cool to see how the map of SFSU on OSM has changed in the past week since starting this project.”

“The first add I made was pinpointing the designated smoking area near the Mary Park residence halls”

“I deleted a Patelco Station because it no longer exists"

“It truly helps to see the data at ground level”

“One of the difficulties I encountered was a problem I can assume happens in OSM often. You have an idea, you plan to do the field work for it, but someone beats you to it!”

"I didn’t have any difficulties using OpenStreetMap, it is fairly simple to use. The digitizing is easy to do OpenStreetMap, I have done it in ArcGIS before."

"One important thing that OSM misses is the 'delete last point' option which is very critical in digitizing."

"Many of the points I added have a margin of error of at least five feet.”

Comments from OSMers!

“JOSM all the way. iD is an entry level / newbie tool.”

"Name is the name only."

"Thank you for your good changeset comments."

"By the way, in one note you mention a 'roof piece' - you can use building=roof if you want to tag a roof piece with no building underneath it. No pressure though ;)"

The Diary Controversy

"I'm really not at all convinced that our diary pages are an appropriate place to be using as a coursework submission system for your students."

OSM as a compulsory assignment means that some students do an obnoxiously bad job

Future / Next Steps

So they've learned how to pull down the data and examine it, tuesday they submit their campus reference maps made in tilemill and hosted by mapbox -- this is the current campus map -- 5 tiles, two zooms

I've seen in the last week as they work with this data a resurgance in interest and a much deeper understanding of what the whole project is like, many of the initial errors we introduced are being corrected, etc.

- gradual understanding of how the data works
- Image of dawn: how default styling choices have been made on OpenStreetMap.org and Mapbox.com, but infinite possibilities
- encouraging attendance at spring editathon

Discussion / Conclusion 

We improved the map
We brought some diversity to OSM
We remain challenged
...with how to reconcile OSM with other standard approaches to mapping...
...with how to teach all of OSM to students with a range of skills and backgrounds...
...with how to introduce newbies to the community...
