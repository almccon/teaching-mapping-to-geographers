Image outline

Introduction
[ ] OSM <-> Geography (OSM logo, AAG Logo?)
[X] Picture of the students in the hallways
[ ] Diagram or similar: GIS, remote sensing, surveying, cartography, & most often with undergraduates: none of the above
[ ] Prior knowledge of geography is a double-edged sword

Our Approach
[ ] Slide(s) for what Alan emphasized in his talk
Slide(s) on how OSM was incorporated:
[x] Mapping close to home
[x] iD
[x] Field Papers
[x] Diary entries
[ ] HOT tasks
[X] Downloading and using the data

Results
[ ] Stats on how many edits
[ ] Scans of field papers
[ ] Animations or before/after pic
[ ] Series of quotes from students, interspersed with comments from OSM contributors
[ ] Aftermath: lots of errors
[ ] Subsequent clean-up rounds
[ ] Image of dawn: gradual understanding of how the data works
[ ] Image of dawn: how default styling choices have been made on OpenStreetMap.org and Mapbox.com, but infinite possibilities
[ ] Building interactive campus maps (current project, due Tuesday).
[ ] Future: encouraging attendance at spring editathon

Discussion
[ ] Backdrop image for discussing +s and -s
[ ] On the + side: improved the map, introduced OSM to an audience with some context for embracing it, able to allow students to incubate
[ ] On the - side: OSM as a compulsory assignment means that some students do an obnoxiously bad job
[ ] Newbies + OSM community
